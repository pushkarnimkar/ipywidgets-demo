# IPywidgets Demo

This is repository demonstrates the power of IPython widgets. I had created this for a talk at SciPy Pune conference. Create a conda enviornment using `environment.yaml` file included and 
open the notebooks using jupyter lab. The `Quick Face Recognizer.ipynb` file uses widgets from [`ipywebrtc`](https://github.com/maartenbreddels/ipywebrtc) to record from web camera and 
run a  face encoder and nearest neighbor-based recognizer on the captured images.

*Note I have not verified if the installation step still works as of 2024*
